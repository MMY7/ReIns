# ReIns

The *ReIns* package contains functions from the book "Reinsurance: Actuarial and Statistical Aspects" (2016) of Hansj√∂rg Albrecher, Jan Beirlant and Jef Teugels.
It contains implementations of

* Basic extreme value theory (EVT) estimators and graphical methods as described in "Statistics of Extremes: Theory and Applications" (2004) of Jan Beirlant, Yuri Goegebeur, Johan Segers and Jef Teugels.

* EVT estimators and graphical methods adapted for censored or truncated data.

* Splicing of mixed Erlang distributions with EVT distributions (Pareto, GPD).


* VaR, expected shortfall and excess-loss premium estimates.

The package is not yet available on CRAN but you can install the latest development version from GitHub using

```
install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("TReynkens/ReIns")
```
